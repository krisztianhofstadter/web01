<p>"Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth. The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance. Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes" ~Alan Watts.</p>
